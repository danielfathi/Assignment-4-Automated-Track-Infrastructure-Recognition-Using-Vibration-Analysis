# Automated Track Infrastructure Recognition Using Vibration Analysis

This repository contains the codes and files for the assignment **Automated Track Infrastructure Recognition Using Vibration Analysis**.  
It includes:
- step 1: Loading and visualizing infrastructure data.
- step 2: Loading GPS/Vibration data and interactive map.
- Filtered event CSV files.
- Labeled segments and extracted features.
- Final report (PDF).

The project detects and classifies railway infrastructure events (Bridge, Rail-joint, Turnout) from vibration and GPS data.
